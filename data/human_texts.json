Using the Top Spotify Songs 2023 dataset (953 tracks, 8\naudio features), we apply three clustering algorithms—K-Means,\nHierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN—and rigorously assess\ncluster validity and interpretability. Our analysis reveals that\nHierarchical Clustering with complete linkage achieves the best\nperformance (Silhouette Score: 0.57, Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.73),\nidentifying two distinct clusters: “Energetic Pop/Dance” (72.3%)\nand “Acoustic/Chill Ballads” (27.7%). All three algorithms con-\nverge on a two-cluster solution, suggesting genuine structure\nin the data rather than algorithmic artifacts. The discovered\nclusters align with domain knowledge about music genres and\ndemonstrate actionable differentiation in audio features. We\nconclude that the Spotify audio features capture meaningful\nmusical characteristics that enable interpretable segmentation,\nwith practical applications for playlist curation and music rec-\nommendation systems.",

K-Means’ lower Silhouette\n(0.23) suggests the clusters aren’t perfectly spherical—an\nassumption K-Means makes but complete linkage does not.\nDBSCAN’s poor performance can be attributed to the\nnature of music audio features. In high-dimensional spaces\nwith relatively homogeneous feature distributions, DBSCAN\nstruggles to identify density variations [2]. Music features tend\nto be uniformly distributed within the feature space rather\nthan forming dense cores with sparse boundaries, which is\nthe structure DBSCAN is designed to detect.

The Silhouette Score, introduced by\nRousseeuw [4], measures how similar points are to their\nown cluster versus neighboring clusters, ranging from -1\n(misclassified) to 1 (well-clustered). For point i, the silhouette\nvalue is defined as s(i) = b(i)−a(i)\nmax(a(i),b(i)) , where a(i) is mean\nintra-cluster distance and b(i) is mean nearest-cluster distance.\nThe Davies-Bouldin Index [5] computes the average simi-\nlarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, where\nsimilarity is the ratio of within-cluster distances to between-\ncluster distance. Lower values indicate better separation.\nThe Calinski-Harabasz Index [6], also known as the\nVariance Ratio Criterion, evaluates the ratio of between-cluster\ndispersion to within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate\ndenser, better-separated clusters. This metric favors convex\nclusters and may bias toward solutions with more clusters.",

These categories are familiar to music listen-\ners and industry professionals, validating that the clustering\ncaptures meaningful distinctions.\n2.

These are not arbitrary\nstatistical patterns but perceptually meaningful attributes.\n3. Actionability: The clusters enable distinct practical ap-\nplications.

The effect arises because the cloudless part of the atmosphere is largely transparent to short-wave radiation from the sun, but less transparent to long-wave infrared radiation emitted by the warm Earth's surface and heated air. The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon; however, human activities are enriching the Earth's atmosphere with additional greenhouse gases, which intensify the greenhouse effect and lead to global warming.\"\n\"\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)",

The similarity to a glass house is that light usually penetrates unhindered into the interior, while the resulting heat cannot escape from the system as easily. This heat barrier to the outside causes heat to accumulate, which raises the internal temperature. Heat loss also increases until it exactly balances the radiated power in the higher temperature equilibrium.",

It is a man-made climate change[1.1] resulting from net greenhouse gas emissions caused by the use of fossil fuels and unsustainable forestry and agriculture since the beginning of industrialization. Greenhouse gas emissions increase the retention capacity for infrared heat radiation in the troposphere, thereby amplifying the natural greenhouse effect. The most important greenhouse gas in current global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), followed by others such as methane and nitrous oxide. The average CO2 concentration in the Earth's atmosphere measured by the Mauna Loa measuring station rose from around 280 ppm before the start of industrialization to over 420 ppm today.",

In its World Energy Outlook 2021, the International Energy Agency estimates the temperature increase at 2.6 °C based on the assumptions of the Stated Policies Scenario; he Climate Action Tracker gives an expected value of 2.6 °C for the year 2100 under Policies & Action",

Animals must be alive and healthy at the time of slaughter and all blood is drained from the carcass.

Just how dangerous are ticks, asks Vanessa Barford.\nExperts have warned, external that ticks - blood-sucking, disease-carrying arachnids - appear to be on the rise in the UK.\nRichard Wall, professor of Zoology at Bristol University, says there's no definitive data on how many ticks are in the country. Some areas have none. Others - usually woodland and heath areas - may have more than 100 per square metre. However, the general consensus among rural communities is they are on the up, largely as a result of the warmer and wetter weather (good breeding conditions) and the growing number of wild deer (ticks like living on their skin).",

The price of ground beef, for example, is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.",

Tehran has long denied any intent to weaponise nuclear fuel production.\nWhile both sides have indicated readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Araqchi balked at widening the talks out.",

An astronaut aboard the International Space Station captured these photographs of the distinct topography on January 26, 2026.\n\nSnow flurries were flying in the area the previous two days, as they were across much of the central and eastern U.S. Hazardous conditions within Grand Canyon National Park prompted officials to close Desert View Drive, which runs along a portion of the South Rim shown in the photo above, and to issue warnings about icy trails.  When the road reopened around the time of these photos, a layer of white remained on both the South Rim, at an elevation of around 7,000 feet, and the North Rim, at about 8,000 feet.",

The grueling event takes more than 2 hours to complete, requiring competitors to ski a distance longer than a marathon. That's still, however, less than an eighth of the distance between the two official host cities of the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics—Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nWith events spread across more than 22,000 square kilometers (8,500 square miles) and eight cities or towns in northern Italy, these are the most geographically dispersed Games in Olympic history. The decentralized design was intentional, allowing planners to control costs and make the event more sustainable by using existing venues rather than constructing several expensive new facilities. More than 90 percent of the venues are existing or temporary facilities, including some refurbished facilities that were used in the 1956 Cortina d’Ampezzo Games.",

Though natural breaks in sea ice are called leads, the better term for the human-made fracture seen in these satellite images is a ship channel.\n\nIn the austral summer, usually in January, an icebreaker rams a path through the fast ice—a type of sea ice that is anchored to the shore—that often covers McMurdo Sound. This annual effort allows cargo ships to reach McMurdo Station, a research base operated by the United States Antarctic Program. The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star completed the task in January 2026, arriving after breaking a path through several miles of ice between the Ross Sea and an ice pier at McMurdo. Most of the channel was cut between January 19 and 20.",
