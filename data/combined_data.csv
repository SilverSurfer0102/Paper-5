h01,human,"Abstract—This study investigates whether unsupervised clus-
tering algorithms can discover interpretable structure in music
data. Using the Top Spotify Songs 2023 dataset (953 tracks, 8
audio features), we apply three clustering algorithms—K-Means,
Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN—and rigorously assess
cluster validity and interpretability. Our analysis reveals that
Hierarchical Clustering with complete linkage achieves the best
performance (Silhouette Score: 0.57, Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.73),
identifying two distinct clusters: “Energetic Pop/Dance” (72.3%)
and “Acoustic/Chill Ballads” (27.7%). All three algorithms con-
verge on a two-cluster solution, suggesting genuine structure
in the data rather than algorithmic artifacts. The discovered
clusters align with domain knowledge about music genres and
demonstrate actionable differentiation in audio features. We
conclude that the Spotify audio features capture meaningful
musical characteristics that enable interpretable segmentation,
with practical applications for playlist curation and music rec-
ommendation systems.",Paper 3,Spotify Interpretable Clustering,134,68.20149230957031
h02,human,"A. Clustering Algorithms
Clustering partitions data into groups based on similarity
without requiring labeled training data. Three major paradigms
exist, each with distinct assumptions and strengths.
K-Means [1] is a centroid-based algorithm that assigns
points to the nearest cluster center iteratively. Starting with k
random centroids, the algorithm alternates between assigning
each point to its nearest centroid and updating centroids as
cluster means until convergence. K-Means assumes spherical
clusters of",Paper 3,Spotify Interpretable Clustering,70,44.186981201171875
h03,human,"This study investigated whether clustering algorithms dis-
cover interpretable structure in Spotify music data. Our key
findings:
1) Yes, clusters are interpretable: Two distinct groups
emerge—“Energetic Pop/Dance” and “Acoustic/Chill
Ballads”—aligned with musical intuition and domain
knowledge
2) Best method: Hierarchical Clustering with complete
linkage achieves Silhouette = 0.57, significantly outper-
forming K-Means (0.23) and DBSCAN (0.20)
3) Genuine structure: Algorithm convergence on k = 2
indicates real patterns inherent to the data, not artifacts
of any single method
4) Actionable results: Clusters enable practical applica-
tions in playlist generation and music recommendation
Answer to Research Question: The discovered clusters
do align with interpretable structure. Spotify’s audio features
capture meaningful musical characteristics that support unsu-
pervised segmentation into recognizable, actionable categories.",Paper 3,Spotify Interpretable Clustering,120,101.56819152832031
h04,human,"Complete linkage measures maximum inter-cluster distance,
making it robust to outliers and effective for identifying
compact, well-separated clusters. K-Means’ lower Silhouette
(0.23) suggests the clusters aren’t perfectly spherical—an
assumption K-Means makes but complete linkage does not.
DBSCAN’s poor performance can be attributed to the
nature of music audio features. In high-dimensional spaces
with relatively homogeneous feature distributions, DBSCAN
struggles to identify density variations [2]. Music features tend
to be uniformly distributed within the feature space rather
than forming dense cores with sparse boundaries, which is
the structure DBSCAN is designed to detect. Additionally, the
13.2% outlier rate, while informative for identifying atypical
songs, reduces the data available for cluster formation and
lowers overall validation scores.",Paper 3,Spotify Interpretable Clustering,115,81.6165771484375
h05,human,"Internal validation metrics assess cluster quality without
ground truth labels. The Silhouette Score, introduced by
Rousseeuw [4], measures how similar points are to their
own cluster versus neighboring clusters, ranging from -1
(misclassified) to 1 (well-clustered). For point i, the silhouette
value is defined as s(i) = b(i)−a(i)
max(a(i),b(i)) , where a(i) is mean
intra-cluster distance and b(i) is mean nearest-cluster distance.
The Davies-Bouldin Index [5] computes the average simi-
larity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, where
similarity is the ratio of within-cluster distances to between-
cluster distance. Lower values indicate better separation.
The Calinski-Harabasz Index [6], also known as the
Variance Ratio Criterion, evaluates the ratio of between-cluster
dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate
denser, better-separated clusters. This metric favors convex
clusters and may bias toward solutions with more clusters.",Paper 3,Spotify Interpretable Clustering,135,31.777935028076172
h06,human,"1. Domain Alignment: The clusters correspond to rec-
ognized music categories—high-energy dance music versus
acoustic ballads. These categories are familiar to music listen-
ers and industry professionals, validating that the clustering
captures meaningful distinctions.
2. Feature Coherence: The differentiating features (energy,
acousticness, danceability) have clear musical meanings. High
energy corresponds to loud, fast, intense music; high acoustic-
ness indicates organic instrumentation. These are not arbitrary
statistical patterns but perceptually meaningful attributes.
3. Actionability: The clusters enable distinct practical ap-
plications. Playlist curators can automatically separate workout
music (Cluster 0) from relaxation music (Cluster 1). Recom-
mendation systems can match user mood or activity to the
appropriate cluster.
4. Algorithm Agreement: Three fundamentally differ-
ent algorithms—centroid-based, density-based, and hierarchi-
cal—independently identify two clusters. This convergence
suggests the structure is inherent to the data rather than
imposed by any single algorithm’s assumptions.

pretable.",Paper 3,Spotify Interpretable Clustering,148,67.53010559082031

2a) The heat radiation is retained by greenhouse gases, causing further warming.
2b) Without greenhouse gases, the heat radiation could escape directly and cool the surface more efficiently.
The greenhouse effect is the effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that prevent the spread of heat radiation, thus causing a higher temperature on the planet's surface. The effect arises because the cloudless part of the atmosphere is largely transparent to short-wave radiation from the sun, but less transparent to long-wave infrared radiation emitted by the warm Earth's surface and heated air. The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon; however, human activities are enriching the Earth's atmosphere with additional greenhouse gases, which intensify the greenhouse effect and lead to global warming.""

It is a man-made climate change[1.1] resulting from net greenhouse gas emissions caused by the use of fossil fuels and unsustainable forestry and agriculture since the beginning of industrialization. Greenhouse gas emissions increase the retention capacity for infrared heat radiation in the troposphere, thereby amplifying the natural greenhouse effect. The most important greenhouse gas in current global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), followed by others such as methane and nitrous oxide.

Because the climate system responds over decades, today’s emissions can shape conditions far into the future.",ChatGPT,Global Warming,115,18.9018497467041
a11,ai,"Global warming is the observed increase in global mean temperature since the late nineteenth century, closely linked to the rapid growth of greenhouse-gas emissions. Human-caused warming results primarily from carbon dioxide released by fossil-fuel combustion and cement production, with additional contributions from methane, nitrous oxide, and land-use change. The warming signal appears across many indicators: higher ocean heat content, shrinking mountain glaciers, declining Arctic sea ice, and a rising global sea level. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which intensifies the hydrological cycle and can amplify extremes, including heavy precipitation events and prolonged dry spells. Warming also affects ecosystems by shifting species ranges, altering seasonal timing, and increasing wildfire risk in many regions. Limiting further warming requires reducing net emissions and, in many pathways, expanding carbon removal through forests, soils, or engineered technologies.",ChatGPT,Global Warming,135,22.352317810058594
a12,ai,"Hydrogen is a chemical element and an energy carrier that can store and deliver energy without emitting carbon dioxide at the point of use. When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, it produces electricity, water, and heat, making it attractive for low-emission transport and industrial processes. However, hydrogen is not a primary energy source; it must be produced from compounds such as water or natural gas. “Green hydrogen” is made by electrolyzing water using renewable electricity, while “gray” and “blue” hydrogen are produced from fossil fuels, with blue including carbon capture. Key challenges include energy losses across production, compression or liquefaction, and distribution, as well as the need for new infrastructure. Hydrogen may be most valuable where direct electrification is difficult, such as steelmaking, shipping, and seasonal energy storage.",ChatGPT,Hydrogen,131,28.341527938842773

a24,ai,"Halal meat comes from animals slaughtered according to Islamic dietary rules. The term halal means “permissible,” and for meat it includes both the type of animal and the way it is processed. Pork is not halal, and animals must be healthy at the time of slaughter. The slaughter is typically performed by a trained person who makes a swift cut to the throat with a sharp knife, allowing blood to drain, and a blessing is recited. Many halal standards also require that the animal be treated humanely and that equipment is cleaned to avoid cross-contamination with non-halal products. Halal certification is often provided by an independent organization that audits farms, slaughterhouses, and supply chains. Practices can vary by country and certifying body, and some halal meat is produced with pre-slaughter stunning if it is considered acceptable under specific guidelines.",ChatGPT,What Is Halal Meat?,139,25.505752563476562

a30,ai,"Cracking Antarctic sea ice refers to the fractures and leads that form as wind, waves, and ocean currents stress the floating ice cover around Antarctica. In winter the ice expands, but it is constantly pushed, compressed, and pulled apart by storms and by the circulation of the Southern Ocean. When the ice splits, openings expose dark water that absorbs more sunlight, which can speed up local melt and delay refreezing. Leads also release heat and moisture to the atmosphere, shaping clouds and regional weather. For wildlife, cracks can be both helpful and risky: seals and penguins may use openings to access food, but rapid breakup can strand or separate habitat. Scientists track crack patterns with satellites and buoys to understand ice strength, predict seasonal extent, and improve climate models better over time.",ChatGPT,Cracking Antarctic Sea Ice,132,52.549110412597656
